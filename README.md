# Bus Tracking Application

This repository contains two Flutter applications designed to track the location of buses in real-time. Initially implemented for a college bus system, this model can be scaled to a state-level transport system like KSRTC. The two applications are:

1. **Driver App**: Allows bus drivers to send their location updates.
2. **User App**: Enables users to select a bus route and view the bus's real-time location on a map.

Both applications use Firebase Realtime Database to update and retrieve the location data in real-time.

## Features

### Driver App
- Real-time location updates sent to Firebase.
- Simple and intuitive user interface for ease of use.

### User App
- Selection of bus routes to track.
- Real-time bus location updates displayed on a map.
- Map integration for visualizing bus routes and locations.

## Technologies Used

## Driver App

The Driver App is designed for bus drivers to send their current location to the Firebase Realtime Database.

### Key Features

- **Location Updates:** The app captures the driver's current location and updates it in real-time to Firebase.

## User App

The User App allows passengers to select a bus route and view the bus's current location on a map.

### Key Features

- **Select Route:** Users can select a bus route to track.
- **Real-Time Tracking:** The bus's real-time location is displayed on a map, updating dynamically as the bus moves.
